## Modeling Worldwide Gross Box Office Collection for Films 2012-2021
By: Rachel Goodridge

## Abstract
Using data from films in 2012-2021 scraped from [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/2021/?grossesOption=calendarGrosses), a model can be produced to determine which features affect the worldwide gross box office of a film. Features including budget, running time, and number of theaters show some positive correlation with worldwide gross. Comparisons can also be made between distributors and genres using dummy variables. Relative to Focus Features, Universal Pictures and Walt Disney Pictures perform better, while Open Road Films performs worse. Relative to Action, adding Animation, Music, and/or Musical aspects to a film would create improvement while Family, Fantasy, and Sports films would not.
